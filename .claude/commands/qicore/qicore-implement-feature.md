# QiCore Foundation Feature Implementation

Project-specific implementation workflow that maintains mathematical rigor and cross-language consistency.

## QiCore Implementation Process:

### Phase 1: Mathematical Foundation Review (**filesystem** + **memory**)
1. Read QiCore Foundation contracts:
   - docs/contracts/qi.base.contracts.md
   - docs/contracts/qi.core.contracts.md
   - docs/contracts/qi.component.contracts.md

2. Review Haskell reference implementation:
   - haskell/qi-base/ (Result<T>, QiError)
   - haskell/qi-core/ (Config, Logger, Cache)

3. **memory**: Store mathematical law requirements
4. Load cross-language consistency requirements

### Phase 2: Mathematical Law Preservation (**sequential-thinking**)
1. Plan implementation to preserve Functor laws
2. Ensure Monad laws will be satisfied
3. Verify Applicative laws can be maintained
4. Design property-based tests for verification

### Phase 3: Cross-Language Implementation
1. Implement following Haskell reference semantics
2. Maintain identical error handling patterns
3. Preserve performance characteristics (O(1) operations)
4. Use monadic composition patterns consistently

### Phase 4: QiCore-Specific Verification
1. Run property-based tests (minimum 1000 iterations)
2. Verify cross-language behavioral consistency
3. Check performance contracts are met
4. Validate against behavioral contracts

## QiCore-Specific Requirements:
- **Mathematical Rigor**: All implementations must satisfy category theory laws
- **Cross-Language Consistency**: Identical behavior across Haskell/TypeScript
- **Performance Contracts**: O(1) operations for core functions
- **Error Handling**: Use Result<T> monad, never throw exceptions
- **STM Concurrency**: Use Software Transactional Memory in Haskell
- **Modern Patterns**: Apply current TypeScript patterns while preserving laws

## QiCore Quality Gates:
- [ ] Functor/Monad/Applicative laws verified
- [ ] Property-based tests with 1000+ iterations
- [ ] Cross-language consistency confirmed
- [ ] Performance contracts satisfied
- [ ] Behavioral contracts followed
- [ ] No exceptions thrown (Result<T> only)

## Example Usage:
"Implement flatMap operation for Result<T> following QiCore mathematical requirements"
"Create Cache service following qi/core behavioral contracts"
"Add error chaining to QiError maintaining cross-language consistency"
