# Create Unit Tests

**INSTRUCTION FOR AI ASSISTANT**: Create comprehensive unit tests for QiCore Foundation components.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Mathematical Law Testing (MANDATORY)
Create property-based tests for all mathematical laws:

**Functor Laws:**
- Identity: `fmap id == id`
- Composition: `fmap (f . g) == fmap f . fmap g`

**Monad Laws:**
- Left Identity: `return a >>= f == f a`
- Right Identity: `m >>= return == m`  
- Associativity: `(m >>= f) >>= g == m >>= (\x -> f x >>= g)`

**Applicative Laws:**
- Identity: `pure id <*> v == v`
- Composition: `pure (.) <*> u <*> v <*> w == u <*> (v <*> w)`
- Homomorphism: `pure f <*> pure x == pure (f x)`
- Interchange: `u <*> pure y == pure ($ y) <*> u`

### 2. Test Implementation Requirements

**For Haskell:**
- Use QuickCheck with minimum 1000 iterations
- Use Tasty test framework
- Create custom Arbitrary instances
- Test all Result<T> operations

**For TypeScript (when implemented):**
- Use Vitest with fast-check
- Property-based testing with 1000+ iterations
- Same mathematical laws as Haskell
- Cross-language consistency verification

### 3. Test Coverage Requirements

**Core Components:**
- Result<T> factory operations
- Result<T> transformation operations (map, flatMap, andThen)
- Result<T> collection operations (partition, sequence, combine2)
- QiError operations (chain, formatChain, hasCategory)
- Configuration loading and validation
- Logger operations and formatting
- Cache operations with performance contracts

**Edge Cases:**
- Null/empty inputs
- Large data sets
- Concurrent operations (Haskell STM)
- Error propagation chains
- Resource cleanup

### 4. Performance Testing
- Verify O(1) complexity guarantees
- Benchmark core operations
- Memory usage regression tests
- STM concurrency safety (Haskell)

## Implementation Steps

1. **Read existing tests** to understand current patterns
2. **Identify missing coverage** by component
3. **Generate property-based tests** for mathematical laws
4. **Create edge case tests** for robustness
5. **Add performance benchmarks** where needed
6. **Verify tests pass** with required iterations

## Success Criteria
- All mathematical laws verified with property-based tests
- Minimum 1000 QuickCheck iterations for each property
- Test coverage above 90% for core components
- All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
- Cross-language consistency verified (when TypeScript implemented)

**Focus on mathematical correctness and comprehensive coverage.**
