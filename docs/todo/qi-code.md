# qi-code Application TODOs

## Vision  
**qi-code** = Advanced coding assistant with QiCore CLI + AgentChat + AutoGen integration

A sophisticated development environment that provides intelligent code generation, review, debugging, and project assistance through multi-agent collaboration and modern terminal interface.

## Current Status Assessment (January 2025)
✅ **FOUNDATION READY**: 
- QiCore CLI framework (`MessageDrivenCLI`) with complete implementation
- State management system (`CLIStateManager` with XState 5)
- Async messaging integration (`@qi/amsg` for multi-agent communication)
- Multi-framework UI support (Ink, Readline, Hybrid)
- Command system foundation (`SimpleCLICommandHandler`)

❌ **MISSING**: 
- AutoGen integration patterns and multi-agent orchestration
- Application-specific command registration for qi-code
- Specialized coding agents (Architect, Developer, Reviewer, Tester)
- Project analysis and context management system

## Architecture Overview

### Core Stack
- **@qi/cli** - Terminal interface and command system
- **@qi/amsg** - Async messaging between agents and components
- **@qi/base + @qi/core** - Functional foundation  
- **AgentChat** - Conversational AI foundation
- **AutoGen** - Multi-agent orchestration and collaboration
- **LLM Providers** - Code-capable models (GPT-4, Claude 3.5, CodeLlama)

### 5. CLI Integration & Commands

#### 5.1 Application Command Registration
**Status**: CLI framework exists, needs application-specific command integration

✅ **Current**: `SimpleCLICommandHandler` provides basic CLI commands (/help, /exit, /clear, /version)
❌ **Needed**: Application-specific command registration for qi-code functionality

- [ ] **Extend CLI Command System for Multi-Agent Workflows**
  ```typescript
  // Register qi-code commands with existing CLI framework
  const cli = new MessageDrivenCLI({
    framework: 'hybrid',
    stateManager: createStateManager(),
    messageQueue: new QiAsyncMessageQueue() // Critical for agent coordination
  })
  
  // Register multi-agent workflow commands
  cli.registerAppCommands(qiCodeCommands)
  
  // AMSG integration is key for agent-to-agent communication
  const agentOrchestrator = new MultiAgentOrchestrator(cli.messageQueue)
  ```

#### 5.2 qi-code Specific Commands  
- [ ] **Project Commands**
  ```bash
  /project init              # Initialize new project with qi-code
  /project analyze           # Full project analysis
  /project status           # Current project status
  /project context          # Show current context
  ```

- [ ] **Agent Commands**
  ```bash
  /agents list              # List available agents
  /agents create <type>     # Create specialized agent
  /agents assign <task>     # Assign task to agent
  /agents collaborate       # Start multi-agent collaboration
  ```

- [ ] **Development Commands**
  ```bash
  /code generate <feature>  # Generate code for feature
  /code review <file>       # Multi-agent code review
  /code refactor <target>   # Refactor code section  
  /code debug <issue>       # Debug with agent team
  /code test <component>    # Generate and run tests
  ```

#### 5.3 State Management Integration
**Status**: CLI state system exists, needs coordination with multi-agent workflows

✅ **Current**: `CLIStateManager` manages internal CLI state with XState 5
❌ **Needed**: Multi-agent workflow state coordination

- [ ] **Agent Workflow State Management**
  ```typescript
  // Coordinate CLI state with multi-agent workflow state
  interface QiCodeState {
    // CLI provides this layer  
    cliState: AppStateContext
    
    // Application manages this layer
    activeWorkflows: WorkflowState[]
    agentStates: AgentState[]
    projectContext: ProjectContext
    currentTask?: CodingTask
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Multi-Agent State Synchronization**
  - Coordinate CLI state with agent workflow states
  - Handle state-dependent agent command execution
  - Synchronize agent states through @qi/amsg
  - Manage workflow persistence across sessions

#### 5.4 Workflow Commands
- [ ] **Workflow Management**
  ```bash
  /workflow start <type>    # Start coding workflow
  /workflow status          # Show active workflows  
  /workflow pause <id>      # Pause workflow
  /workflow resume <id>     # Resume workflow
  /workflow results <id>    # Show workflow results
  ```
