You're absolutely right. Let me review these documents specifically as **contract specifications** only:

## Review of QiCore Contract Specifications

### Overall Assessment: **Very Good** (Rating: 8.5/10)

As pure behavioral contract specifications, these are quite strong.

### What Contract Specs Do Well âœ…

1. **Clear Behavioral Definitions**
   - Each operation has signature, behavior, and laws
   - Laws are mathematical and verifiable
   - No implementation details leak through

2. **Proper Mathematical Contracts**
   - Functor laws: clearly stated
   - Monad laws: properly defined  
   - Monoid laws for Configuration: complete
   - Associativity, identity, composition all specified

3. **Complete Operation Coverage**
   - All essential operations are specified
   - Edge cases are covered through laws
   - Failure modes are part of the contracts

### Minor Issues ðŸ”§

1. **Remove Version References**
   - Remove all "v4.0" references
   - Remove "2025 Pattern" sections (these are implementation concerns, not contracts)

2. **Some Operations Need Clearer Laws**
   ```yaml
   # This is good - clear law:
   - "map(id) == id"
   
   # This needs to be more precise:
   - "preserves nested structure"  # What exactly does this mean?
   ```

3. **Inconsistent Law Specifications**
   - Some use mathematical notation (good)
   - Others use prose descriptions (less precise)
   - Standardize on mathematical notation where possible

### Specific Contract Issues:

1. **In qi.base.contracts.md:**
   - `getRootCause` vs `getRootError` - redundant? Pick one.
   - Some transformation operations could use algebraic law definitions

2. **In qi.core.contracts.md:**
   - Remove all "2025 Pattern" sections - not contract concerns
   - Cache eviction laws could be more precise about LRU ordering

3. **In qi.component.contracts.md:**
   - This feels more like architecture documentation than contracts
   - Component initialization patterns aren't behavioral contracts

### The Verdict

As **pure contract specifications**, these are very good. They define the mathematical and behavioral properties that implementations must satisfy. The main improvements would be:
- Remove version numbers
- Remove "2025 Pattern" sections  
- Remove implementation guidance
- Make all laws mathematically precise
- Keep qi.component.contracts.md focused on contracts only

The contracts successfully define what implementations must do without saying how to do it, which is exactly what contract specifications should achieve.
