# QiCore v4.0 Core Component Contracts

This document defines pure behavioral contracts for QiCore v4.0 **Core Component** types (Configuration, Logger, Cache). These contracts are completely language-agnostic and specify only the mathematical and behavioral properties that any implementation must satisfy.

**Dependencies**: This specification depends on [Base Component Contracts](qi.v4.base.contracts.md) for Result<T> and QiError types.

## 1. Configuration Behavioral Contract

### Mathematical Foundation
- **Monoid Structure**: Configuration forms a monoid with associative merge operation and empty identity
- **Immutability**: All configuration objects are immutable after creation
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing for configuration values with validation

### Configuration Data Contract

```yaml
ConfigData:
  structure: "Nested key-value mapping"
  immutability: "Read-only after creation"
  serialization: "JSON/YAML/TOML compatible"
  
laws:
  - "all configuration data is immutable"
  - "nested structures preserved during operations"
  - "type information maintained where possible"
```

### Factory Operations

```yaml
fromFile:
  signature: "FilePath → Result<ConfigData>"
  behavior: "Load configuration from file (async)"
  laws:
    - "supports JSON, YAML, TOML formats"
    - "auto-detects format from file extension"
    - "returns PARSING error for invalid format"
    - "returns FILESYSTEM error for file access issues"

fromObject:
  signature: "Object → Result<ConfigData>"
  behavior: "Create configuration from object/map"
  laws:
    - "preserves nested structure"
    - "validates object structure"
    - "returns VALIDATION error for invalid structure"

fromString:
  signature: "String → Format → Result<ConfigData>"
  behavior: "Parse configuration from string content"
  laws:
    - "format parameter specifies JSON/YAML/TOML"
    - "returns PARSING error for syntax errors"
    - "preserves type information where possible"

fromEnvironment:
  signature: "Prefix? → Result<ConfigData>"
  behavior: "Load configuration from environment variables"
  laws:
    - "prefix filters environment variables"
    - "converts ENV_VAR_NAME to nested.var.name structure"

    - "missing prefix loads all environment variables"
```

### Query Operations

```yaml

  signature: "List<ConfigData> → Result<ConfigData>"
  behavior: "Merge multiple configurations (monoid operation)"
  laws:
    # Monoid Laws
    - "associativity: merge([a, merge([b, c])]) == merge([merge([a, b]), c])"
    - "left identity: merge([empty, config]) == config"
    - "right identity: merge([config, empty]) == config"
    # Merge Behavior
    - "right-biased: later configs override earlier ones"
    - "deep merge: nested objects merged recursively"

```
