### Component Contracts are Essential
You make an excellent point about `qi.component.contracts.md`. Upon reflection, this file serves a critical purpose:

**Why Component Contracts Matter:**
- **Structural Consistency**: Without defining the component hierarchy (Base → Core → Application), each language implementation could organize things differently
- **Dependency Management**: Clear specification that HTTP/Document/CLP depend on Core, which depends on Base
- **Initialization Patterns**: Ensures all implementations handle async initialization consistently
- **Interface Boundaries**: Defines what each component exports and how they interact

This is indeed a **behavioral contract** - it specifies the behavior of component dependencies and initialization, not implementation details.

## Revised Assessment of docs/contracts

**Rating: 9/10** - Excellent contract specifications

The contracts are actually even better than I initially assessed:
- Pure mathematical specifications without version coupling
- Component contracts provide essential structural guidance
- Clear separation of concerns between Base, Core, and Component layers
- All three files work together to ensure consistent implementations across languages

The only minor suggestions would be:
- Some prose descriptions could be more mathematically precise
- Perhaps add a few more laws for component initialization sequences

## Detailed Suggestions for Contract Improvements

### 1. Prose Descriptions That Need Mathematical Precision

#### In `qi.base.contracts.md`:

**Current prose descriptions:**
```yaml
fromObject:
  laws:
    - "validates object structure"
    - "preserves nested structure"
```

**Suggested mathematical precision:**
```yaml
fromObject:
  laws:
    - "validates object structure" → "for all keys k in object: typeof(object[k]) ∈ {string, number, boolean, object, array, null}"
    - "preserves nested structure" → "depth(fromObject(obj).value) == depth(obj) ∧ ∀k∈keys(obj): hasPath(result, k)"
```

#### In `qi.core.contracts.md`:

**Current prose descriptions:**
```yaml
ConfigData:
  laws:
    - "nested structures preserved during operations"
    - "type information maintained where possible"
```

**Suggested mathematical precision:**
```yaml
ConfigData:
  laws:
    - "nested structures preserved" → "∀ path p, value v: set(p, v, config) ⟹ get(p, config) == v"
    - "type information maintained" → "∀ value v: type(get(path, set(path, v, config))) == type(v)"
```

**Cache eviction prose:**
```yaml
eviction_laws:
  - "least recently used entries evicted first when maxSize exceeded"
```

**Suggested mathematical precision:**
```yaml
eviction_laws:
  - "LRU eviction": "size(cache) > maxSize ⟹ evict(cache, argmin(e ∈ entries(cache), lastAccess(e)))"
  - "access ordering": "get(k1, cache) < get(k2, cache) ⟹ lastAccess(k1) < lastAccess(k2)"
```

### 2. Additional Laws for Component Initialization Sequences

#### Missing Initialization Order Laws

**Current state**: The component contracts mention initialization patterns but don't specify precise ordering laws.

**Suggested additional laws:**

```yaml
initialization_sequence_laws:
  # Strict ordering law
  - "initialization_order": "∀ components c1, c2: depends(c2, c1) ⟹ init(c1) < init(c2)"
  
  # Failure propagation law
  - "cascade_failure": "isFailure(init(c1)) ∧ depends(c2, c1) ⟹ isFailure(init(c2))"
  
  # Idempotency law
  - "init_idempotent": "init(init(component)) == init(component)"
  
  # Recovery law
  - "partial_initialization": "isFailure(init(core)) ⟹ isSuccess(init(base))"
```

#### Missing State Transition Laws

```yaml
component_state_laws:
  # State progression
  - "state_sequence": "state ∈ {uninitialized → initializing → initialized | failed}"
  
  # No backward transitions
  - "monotonic_state": "transition(s1, s2) ⟹ s1 < s2 in state ordering"
  
  # Observable state
  - "state_query": "∀t: isInitialized(component) ⟺ state(component, t) == initialized"
```

#### Missing Resource Management Laws

```yaml
resource_lifecycle_laws:
  # Acquisition before use
  - "acquire_before_use": "use(resource) ⟹ ∃t: acquire(resource, t) ∧ t < now"
  
  # Release guarantee
  - "release_on_failure": "isFailure(init(component)) ⟹ ∀r ∈ acquired(component): released(r)"
  
  # No leak law
  - "resource_balance": "terminated(component) ⟹ |acquired| == |released|"
```

#### Missing Async Initialization Laws

```yaml
async_initialization_laws:
  # Completion guarantee
  - "async_completion": "∀ async init: ∃t: completed(init, t) ∨ failed(init, t)"
  
  # Timeout behavior
  - "timeout_bound": "∀ async init: duration(init) > timeout ⟹ failed(init, TIMEOUT)"
  
  # Concurrent safety
  - "concurrent_init": "parallel(init(c1), init(c2)) ≡ sequential(init(c1), init(c2)) when ¬depends(c1, c2) ∧ ¬depends(c2, c1)"
```

### 3. Additional Clarifications Needed

#### Error Propagation Precision
```yaml
error_propagation:
  current: "errors propagate through initialization"
  precise: "∀ error e in init(c1): depends(c2, c1) ⟹ cause(error(init(c2))) == e"
```

#### Configuration Validation Precision
```yaml
validation_laws:
  current: "validates nested structures"
  precise: "∀ path p in schema: has(p, config) ∧ type(get(p, config)) == type(schema[p])"
```

These mathematical specifications would make the contracts more precise and verifiable through property-based testing, ensuring consistent implementation across all languages.
