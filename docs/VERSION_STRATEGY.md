# QiCore Foundation Version Strategy

## Overview

QiCore Foundation follows a structured versioning approach that separates **basic functionality implementation** across languages from **advanced feature development**. This ensures consistent cross-language behavioral contracts before adding complexity.

## Version Definition Schema

### Pre-1.0 Phase: Multi-Language Basic Implementation

**Target**: Implement core qi/base and qi/core **basic functionalities** across all target languages with mathematical law compliance and cross-language behavioral consistency.

| Version Range | Language | Focus | Status |
|---------------|----------|-------|--------|
| **v-0.2.x** | **Haskell** | Reference implementation | ✅ v-0.2.4 Complete |
| **v-0.3.x** | **TypeScript** | Production ecosystem | 🔄 Planning |

| **v-0.6.x** | **Go** | Cloud/microservices | 📋 Queued |
| **v-0.7.x** | **Rust** | Systems programming | 📋 Queued |

### Integration & Stabilization Phase

| Version Range | Focus | Purpose |
|---------------|-------|---------|
| **v-0.8.x** | **Cross-Language Issue Resolution** | Fix behavioral inconsistencies discovered during v-0.2.x to v-0.7.x implementations |
| **v-0.9.x** | **Final Stabilization** | Address remaining issues from v-0.8.x, prepare for v-1.0.0 |

### Production Phase: Advanced Features

| Version Range | Focus | Scope |
|---------------|-------|-------|

## Basic Functionality Definition

### qi/base (Mathematical Foundations)
**REQUIRED for all language implementations:**

#### Core Types
- ✅ **Result<T, E>** with complete monadic operations
- ✅ **QiError** with category-based error handling
- ✅ **Mathematical Laws**: Functor, Applicative, Monad compliance

#### Factory Operations
- ✅ `success(value)` → `Result<T>`
- ✅ `failure(error)` → `Result<never, E>`
- ✅ `fromMaybe(option)` → `Result<T>`
- ✅ `fromTryCatch(operation)` → `Result<T>`

#### Monadic Operations
- ✅ `map(fn)` → transform success values
- ✅ `flatMap(fn)` → monadic bind operation  
- ✅ `collect()` → flatten nested Results

#### Query Operations
- ✅ `isSuccess()` / `isFailure()` → boolean checks
- ✅ `getValue()` / `getError()` → value extraction
- ✅ `match(onSuccess, onFailure)` → pattern matching

#### Error Operations
- ✅ `chain(primaryError, secondaryError)` → error correlation
- ✅ `withContext(context)` → add debugging context
- ✅ `withCause(cause)` → causal relationship

### qi/core (Infrastructure Services)
**REQUIRED for all language implementations:**

#### Configuration Component
- ✅ **Monoid semantics** with right-biased merging
- ✅ **Multi-format support**: JSON (required), YAML/TOML (optional)
- ✅ **Environment variable** loading with type coercion
- ✅ **Validation** with required keys and type checking
- ✅ **Nested key access** with dot notation support

#### Logger Component  
- ✅ **Hierarchical log levels** with O(1) checking
- ✅ **Structured logging** with context fields
- ✅ **Multiple destinations**: Console, File, Network (basic)
- ✅ **OpenTelemetry integration** with trace context
- ✅ **Performance optimization** for production use

#### Cache Component
- ✅ **Multiple backends**: Memory, Persistent, Distributed
- ✅ **LRU eviction** with configurable size limits
- ✅ **TTL expiration** with automatic cleanup
- ✅ **Thread-safe operations** (STM/locks/async as appropriate)
- ✅ **Basic statistics** for monitoring

## Advanced Features (v-1.x.x)

### NOT INCLUDED in Basic Functionality (Reserved for v-1.x.x):

#### Network & HTTP
- ❌ **HTTP clients** (full request/response handling)
- ❌ **Advanced authentication** (OAuth, JWT, certificates)
- ❌ **Circuit breakers** and advanced resilience patterns
- ❌ **Advanced retry logic** with exponential backoff

#### Advanced Observability
- ❌ **Metrics collection** and aggregation
- ❌ **Custom metric types** (gauges, histograms, counters)
- ❌ **Advanced tracing** with span relationships
- ❌ **Performance profiling** integration

#### Specialized Integrations
- ❌ **Database connections** and ORM patterns
- ❌ **Message queue** integrations
- ❌ **Advanced caching** (distributed coordination, cache warming)
- ❌ **Serialization protocols** beyond JSON

#### Performance Optimizations
- ❌ **Memory pooling** and advanced allocation strategies
- ❌ **Parallel processing** frameworks
- ❌ **Streaming** and reactive patterns
- ❌ **JIT optimizations** and language-specific performance tuning

## Cross-Language Requirements

### Mathematical Compliance (Non-Negotiable)
- **Property-based testing** with identical test cases across languages
- **Functor laws**: `map(id) == id`, `map(f ∘ g) == map(f) ∘ map(g)`
- **Monad laws**: left identity, right identity, associativity
- **Applicative laws**: identity, composition, homomorphism, interchange

### Performance Contracts (Required)
- **O(1) operations**: Logger level checking, Result operations
- **O(log k) operations**: Configuration key lookup
- **Memory bounds**: Configurable cache size limits
- **Concurrency safety**: All operations thread-safe within language conventions

### Error Handling Consistency (Required)
- **No exceptions** in Result<T> operations across all languages
- **Identical error categories** and severity levels
- **Consistent error message** formats for debugging
- **Context preservation** in error chaining
