  ‚úÖ Memory MCP Server Storage

  Location: /home/zzhang/.npm/_npx/15b07286cbcc3329/node_modules/@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory/dist/memory.json

  Storage Type: JSON file (not SQLite database)
  Content: All our QiCore project knowledge is stored there! I can see:
  - QiCore Foundation TypeScript Implementation entity
  - All development observations and progress
  - Technology knowledge (TypeScript 2025, Bun, Biome, Vitest)
  - User quality standards and requirements
  - Problem tracking and resolutions
  - Relationship mappings between entities

  ‚úÖ Sequential Thinking MCP Server Storage

  Location: /home/zzhang/.npm/_npx/de2bd410102f5eda/node_modules/@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking/

  Storage Type: Session-based (likely in-memory or temporary files)
  Content: Thinking chains and reasoning steps during problem-solving

  üìä Storage Summary

  | MCP Server          | Storage Location                               | Persistence     | Content                                   |
  |---------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
  | Memory              | ~/.npm/_npx/.../server-memory/dist/memory.json | ‚úÖ Persistent    | Project knowledge, entities, observations |
  | Sequential Thinking | ~/.npm/_npx/.../server-sequential-thinking/    | ‚ùì Session-based | Reasoning chains, hypothesis testing      |

  Key Insight: The memory system persists your project knowledge across Claude Code sessions, which is why it could remember all our QiCore
   development progress! The sequential thinking server appears to be more session-oriented for active problem-solving.

  The memory.json file contains the complete knowledge graph we've built about the QiCore project, including all the technical decisions,
  quality standards, and development history.
