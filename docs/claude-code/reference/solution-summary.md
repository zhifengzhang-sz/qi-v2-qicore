# Perfect Claude Code Workflow

Solves outdated knowledge + design compliance problems.

## The Complete Process:
### Phase 1: Knowledge & Design Loading
1. **claude /tech-check** - Load current technology knowledge
2. **claude /design-first** - Read ALL design documentation  
3. **claude /create-design-index** - Map design docs if needed
4. Store everything in **memory** for session consistency

### Phase 2: Design-Compliant Implementation
1. **claude /implement-feature** - Implement following design exactly
2. Use current technology patterns from knowledge base
3. Reference design docs for every implementation decision
4. Apply modern TypeScript/Bun/Biome/Vitest patterns

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance
1. **claude /check-compliance** - Verify design compliance
2. Run automated compliance checker
3. **claude /fix-issues** - Fix any violations found
4. Store successful patterns in **memory**

## Example Session:
```bash
cd ~/dev/qi/github/qi-v2-qicore

# Load knowledge and design
claude /tech-check
claude /design-first

# Implement feature
claude "Implement user authentication following design docs and using current Bun/TypeScript patterns"

# Verify compliance
claude /check-compliance
python ~/.claude/scripts/check-design-compliance.py .

# Store patterns for consistency
claude "Remember this authentication implementation pattern for future features"
```

## Success Criteria:
✅ Current technology patterns applied (Bun, Biome, Vitest, TypeScript)
✅ All design documents consulted and followed
✅ Implementation matches architecture exactly
✅ Compliance verification passes
✅ Patterns stored for consistency

## Result:
- Fast, correct implementations using current best practices
- Perfect design compliance every time
- Consistent patterns across all features
- No more outdated or incorrect code
