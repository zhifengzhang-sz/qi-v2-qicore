## TypeScript Adaptations Documented

### Language-Specific Enhancements
- **Discriminated Unions**: `Result<T, E>` uses `{ tag: 'success' | 'failure' }` for exhaustive pattern matching
- **Type Guards**: `isSuccess` and `isFailure` provide compile-time type narrowing
- **Generic Error Parameter**: `Result<T, E = QiError>` allows custom error types while defaulting to QiError
- **Type Exports**: `Success<T>` and `Failure<E>` types for enhanced developer experience

### Contract Compliance Adaptations
- **Function Parameter Order**: Functions take Result as last parameter for better composition
- **Pure Functions**: No methods on types, all operations as standalone functions
- **Immutability**: All operations return new instances, never mutate existing ones
- **Error Safety**: Never throw exceptions from Result operations

### Rationale Documentation
- **Discriminated Unions**: Leverage TypeScript's exhaustive checking for pattern matching
- **Generic Error Types**: Allow broader usage while maintaining type safety
- **Function-Last Style**: Enable partial application and better composition
- **Type Guards**: Provide both runtime safety and compile-time type narrowing
