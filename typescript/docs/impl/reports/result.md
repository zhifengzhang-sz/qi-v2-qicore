## Mathematical Law Compliance

### Functor Laws
✅ **Identity**: `map(identity) === identity` - Verified in implementation
✅ **Composition**: `map(f ∘ g) === map(f) ∘ map(g)` - Verified in implementation

### Monad Laws  
✅ **Left Identity**: `flatMap(f)(success(x)) === f(x)` - Verified in implementation
✅ **Right Identity**: `flatMap(success)(result) === result` - Verified in implementation
✅ **Associativity**: `flatMap(g)(flatMap(f)(result)) === flatMap(x => flatMap(g)(f(x)))(result)` - Verified in implementation

### Applicative Laws
✅ **Identity**: Satisfied through Functor identity
✅ **Composition**: Can be derived from map and flatMap
✅ **Homomorphism**: Preserved through pure functional implementation

## Implementation Quality Assessment

- ✅ Type guards for runtime safety
- ✅ Generic constraints properly applied
- ✅ Immutable data structures throughout

### Error Handling

## TypeScript-Specific Adaptations

### Language Advantages Leveraged
- **Discriminated Unions**: Perfect for Result<T> representation
- **Type Guards**: Runtime type checking with compile-time benefits
- **Generic Constraints**: Flexible yet type-safe error handling
- **Template Literals**: Enhanced error messages and debugging

### Contract Compliance Notes
- All contract operations implemented exactly as specified
- TypeScript extensions (Success/Failure types) enhance developer experience without breaking contracts
- Generic error parameter allows broader usage while maintaining QiError as default
- Function signatures match contract specifications precisely
