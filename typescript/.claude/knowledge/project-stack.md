# QiCore Foundation Project Technology Stack

## Current Dependencies
Based on project analysis:

### Core Technologies
- **Haskell**: Reference implementation with mathematical rigor
- **TypeScript**: Production-ready implementation (planned)
- **Nix**: Development environment reproducibility

### Build Tools
- **Cabal**: Haskell build system
- **Bun**: TypeScript runtime and package manager (when implemented)

### Quality Assurance
- **Property-based testing**: QuickCheck (Haskell), fast-check (TypeScript)
- **Biome**: Formatting and linting (TypeScript)
- **Vitest**: Testing framework (TypeScript)

## Configuration Files Status
- Haskell cabal files: ✅ Present
- TypeScript tsconfig.json: ❌ Not yet implemented
- Biome biome.json: ❌ Not yet implemented  
- Vitest vitest.config.ts: ❌ Not yet implemented

## Project-Specific Patterns

### Mathematical Rigor Requirements
- All implementations must satisfy Functor, Monad, Applicative laws
- Property-based testing with minimum 1000 iterations
- Cross-language behavioral consistency

### Architecture Constraints
- Category theory-based Result<T> monad
- O(1) complexity guarantees for core operations
- STM concurrency safety (Haskell)
- Error handling without exceptions

### Development Workflow
- Haskell serves as mathematical reference
- Behavioral contracts in docs/contracts/ are authoritative
- All language implementations must pass identical tests
