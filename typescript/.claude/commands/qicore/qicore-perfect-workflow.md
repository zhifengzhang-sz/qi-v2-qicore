# QiCore Foundation Perfect Workflow

Complete development workflow for QiCore Foundation with mathematical rigor and cross-language consistency.

## The QiCore Process:

### Phase 1: Foundation Knowledge Loading
1. **claude /tech-check** - Load current TypeScript/Haskell patterns (global)
2. **claude /qicore-design-first** - Read QiCore design docs and contracts (project)
3. Load mathematical law requirements from .claude/knowledge/
4. Store QiCore Foundation context in **memory**

### Phase 2: QiCore-Compliant Implementation
1. **claude /qicore-implement-feature** - Implement with mathematical rigor
2. Use current technology patterns from global knowledge
3. Reference QiCore contracts for every decision
4. Maintain Haskell reference implementation compatibility

### Phase 3: QiCore Quality Assurance
1. **claude /qicore-check-compliance** - Verify mathematical laws and contracts
2. Run property-based tests (1000+ iterations)
3. Verify cross-language consistency
4. Check performance contracts (O(1) operations)

## QiCore Example Session:
```bash
cd ~/dev/qi/github/qi-v2-qicore

# Load global tech knowledge + QiCore contracts
claude /tech-check
claude /qicore-design-first

# Implement QiCore feature
claude "Implement Result<T>.sequence operation following QiCore mathematical contracts"

# Verify QiCore compliance
claude /qicore-check-compliance

# Store QiCore patterns
claude "Remember this Result<T> implementation pattern for QiCore consistency"
```

## QiCore Success Criteria:
✅ Current technology patterns applied (Bun, TypeScript, Cabal, Haskell)
✅ QiCore behavioral contracts followed exactly
✅ Mathematical laws verified with property-based tests (1000+ iterations)
✅ Cross-language consistency maintained (Haskell ↔ TypeScript)
✅ Performance contracts satisfied (O(1) operations)
✅ No exceptions thrown (Result<T> monad only)
✅ STM concurrency patterns applied (Haskell)

## QiCore-Specific Benefits:
- **Mathematical Correctness**: Category theory laws always satisfied
- **Cross-Language Reliability**: Identical behavior across implementations
- **Performance Guarantees**: O(1) complexity contracts maintained
- **Foundation Quality**: Solid base for entire QiCore platform
- **Research Grade**: Suitable for academic and production use

## Integration with Global Workflow:
- Uses global tech knowledge (TypeScript, Bun, etc.)
- Adds QiCore-specific mathematical requirements
- Maintains project-specific design compliance
- Ensures foundation stability for dependent projects
